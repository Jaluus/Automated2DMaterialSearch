in hbn_20x.json
parameters mainly work fine for me, sometimes finds really thick grey stuff, but I don't care.

50x images too bright, decrease exposure from 70 sm to ? ms?
100x: why is the gain at 100x and the exposure so short? You hope to reduce the wobbling? I would avoid high gain but increase the illumination, that is the light, both aperture and voltage.
