\subsection{Deep Learning based approaches}
Currently there are a plethora of other approaches based upon deep learning (DL) methods.
These hold a multitude of advantages compared to our approach. 

\paragraph{Uneven lighting}
The DL models were able to learn the shape of the vignette on pictures and
\\
\\
But there are also a lot of disadvantages compared to our approach

\paragraph{Inference Time}
DL models tend to be bulky and need powerful graphics cards while performing calculations to find flakes, in one example a Nvidea Tesla V100 GPU is needed in order to run a Retina Net Neural Network in order to generate bounding boxes, this process takes 870ms per image \cite{Shin_2021}, while only generation bounding boxes without segmentation, our algorithm runs  with about 150 ms while segmenting the flake and classifying it whilst running on an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU.

\paragraph{Large Training Dataset needed}
In order to train these models we need 

\paragraph{Long Training times}

\paragraph{Results not guaranteed}

\paragraph{hard to tweak}

\paragraph{No understanding of the underlying Algorithm}
