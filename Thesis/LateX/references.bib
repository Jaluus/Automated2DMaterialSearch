abstract={Deep-learning algorithms enable precise image recognition based on high-dimensional hierarchical image features. Here, we report the development and implementation of a deep-learning-based image segmentation algorithm in an autonomous robotic system to search for two-dimensional (2D) materials. We trained the neural network based on Mask-RCNN on annotated optical microscope images of 2D materials (graphene, hBN, MoS2, and WTe2). The inference algorithm is run on a 1024{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}1024 px2 optical microscope images for 200{\thinspace}ms, enabling the real-time detection of 2D materials. The detection process is robust against changes in the microscopy conditions, such as illumination and color balance, which obviates the parameter-tuning process required for conventional rule-based detection algorithms. Integrating the algorithm with a motorized optical microscope enables the automated searching and cataloging of 2D materials. This development will allow researchers to utilize a large number of 2D materials simply by exfoliating and running the automated searching process. To facilitate research, we make the training codes, dataset, and model weights publicly available.},

	abstract = {Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure constructed from atomically thin layered materials provides quantum material platforms with emergent physical phenomena and novel device applications. While stacking atomically thin vdW layers in combination with automate machine vision identification and semi-automated stacking have been demonstrated, a combination of machine learning based automatic detection/identification assembly capability is necessary to further advance vdW heterostructure fabrication. Here, we developed a new automatic optical detection technique with a deep neural network (DNN) incorporated into a motorized microscope that automatically scans entire silicon wafers to detect and identify two-dimensional (2D) materials. We demonstrated the automated combination on an optical microscope (OM) with a DNN algorithm that enables identification and classification of graphene with different sizes, shapes and thicknesses. For this purpose, we trained a representative DNN for object detection with approximately 1000 OM images, resulting in high accuracy in detection and classification. We further verified the effectiveness of graphene trained DNN (GT-DNN) in practice, by confirming the yield of flakes depending on exfoliation method. In addition, we also showed the transferability of our method to other 2D materials. Our pre-trained GT-DNN was used to train a detection model for hexagonal boron nitride with only a few samples, resulting in further improvement of the accuracy of DNN-based detection. Our experimental method can effectively be extended to automatic detection and assembly of a plethora of 2D materials.}

abstract={Van der Waals heterostructures are comprised of stacked atomically thin two-dimensional crystals and serve as novel materials providing unprecedented properties. However, the random natures in positions and shapes of exfoliated two-dimensional crystals have required the repetitive manual tasks of optical microscopy-based searching and mechanical transferring, thereby severely limiting the complexity of heterostructures. To solve the problem, here we develop a robotic system that searches exfoliated two-dimensional crystals and assembles them into superlattices inside the glovebox. The system can autonomously detect 400 monolayer graphene flakes per hour with a small error rate (<7{\%}) and stack four cycles of the designated two-dimensional crystals per hour with few minutes of human intervention for each stack cycle. The system enabled fabrication of the superlattice consisting of 29 alternating layers of the graphene and the hexagonal boron nitride. This capacity provides a scalable approach for prototyping a variety of van der Waals superlattices.},
