We used MySQL as the Database server in order to easily store the data.
There are a lot of advantages when using MySQL compared to other servers.

\paragraph{Open Source}
One of the biggest advantages of MySQL is that it is Open Source under the MIT License which gives us the ability to use it in a commercial environment without licensing fees as well as the ability to distribute the software freely.

\paragraph{Established Software}
MySQL is already used by the institute, so minimal training is needed to use it.
There is also a lot of documentation about MySQL available which makes it easy to fix errors and customize the installation for our use.

\paragraph{Python Connector Availability}
Another big reason for MySQL is the availability of multiple connectors and ORMs to connect to the database via the program. This removes the necessity to write raw SQL and gives the ability to focus on the data and not on the SQL.
