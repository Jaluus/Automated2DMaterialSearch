  - As a Starting Point
  - How I differ

## What can the Setup do
- Microscope
- Camera
- XY-Tango Plate

## Programm Flow
- Program flow
  - How does the Detection work
  - How do the Drivers work
  - How does the Database Operate
  - How does the Frontend work

## The Detection Algorithm

## The Database
- What does it store
- The Frontend
## The Drivers


## Extracted Data
