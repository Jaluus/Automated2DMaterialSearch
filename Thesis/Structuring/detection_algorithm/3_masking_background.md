# Masking out the background

We first create a Colorhistogram of the Image => Show the Histogram

Then we find the maximum of the Histogram

We mark the Proximity of the maximum (Around the peak) => Show in the Histogram

Something like left is the image and right is the Histogram

Maybe use 90% of the Heigth of the peak

Small impuritys in the image are getting ignored as we use a mean
