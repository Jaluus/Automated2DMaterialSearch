# Calculating the contrasts of the image

The Contrast of the Image is Calculated by using

$
C^{R,G,B} = \frac{I^{R,G,B} - \bar{I}^{R,G,B}_{Background}}
{\bar{I}^{R,G,B}_{Background}}
$

with

$
\bar{I}^{R,G,B}_{Background} = 1/n \sum^n I^{R,G,B}_{Background}
$

The Contrast of the image is in Theory not dependend on the Lighting conditions as it denotes the fraction of photons hitting the CMOS sensor of the camera.

Possible non linear effects are not yet determined, this still needs a more research
